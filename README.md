# Exoplanets Exploration -> machine_learning_challenge

The present project attempts to predict if the observations done by the NASA Kepler space telescope might be candidate to exoplanets or are unlikely to be.

For this task, several models were put to test in order to get the model with the best prediction score. After the best model was chosen, a model tuning was performed to improve its predictions and was put to test once more.

Thanks!
